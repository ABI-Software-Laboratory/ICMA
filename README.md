Update Nov 2018
---------------
The browser based front end of ICMA 2015 release has ceased to work due to changes in browser technologies.
A python based GUI tool that provides almost all the facilities has been developed. The tool and the code is available in the Python subdirectory. To run the tool, download the contents of the ICMA2.0 subdirectory and follow the instructions provided in ICMA2.0/README

Source code (in folders CPP and, J2EE) from the previous release have not be removed. However, they will no longer be maintained or supported.
