				<h2>Patient Ultrasound Dashboard</h2>
				<p>
					The Cardiac-Ultrasound dashboard, "US Scans", collates all the
					cardiac-ultrasound scans related to the selected patient. Note that
					this list may not be the most upto date. <br> The scans are
					listed from the oldest to the latest and presented as a
					tab. Each study consists of observations along one or more ultrasound
					diagnostic view axis. Each view is associated with some metadata
					such as the times at which R-wave begins and ends, and the recorded
					beats per minute for the cine recording and other metadata. By
					default, the cine and metadata associated with the first view in the
					&#8216;Views&#8217; portal is loaded when a study tab is selected.
					The cine can be played or queried using the playable video widget
					at the centre of the dashboard.

				<p>S. View organiser, lists all the views that are associated
					with the study. The current view displayed in V is highlighted with
					a light shadow. Another view can be loaded by clicking on its image
					in the view organiser.</p>
				<p>P. The number of pages within the view organiser. Views are
					organised as five per page, when a study has more than five views,
					additional pages are created. The number of such pages is indicated

				<p>Strain analysis requires a model to be fitted to the wall
					motion in the view(s) of interest. The fitting process involves
					three stages</p>
				<p>1. Select views for determining left ventricular geometry</p>
				<p>2. Specify endocardial boundary and base-plane at end
					diastole (ED) and end systole (ES) for long axis view planes</p>
				<p>3. Verify tracked boundary and fit a model</p>
			</div>
			<!-- Accordion item -->
			<div data-dojo-type="dijit.TitlePane" title="View Selection"
				open="false">
				<p>One of more views can be used to determine the left
					ventricular (LV) chamber&#8217;s geometry. A maximum of six views
					can be used and a minimum of one long axis view (Apical Long Axis
					or Four chamber or Two chamber) is required.</p>
				<p>
					<img width="602" height="234" src="./ABI/helpdocs/USW1.png" />
				</p>
				<p>The orientation of a view-cine with respect to the LV
					geometry is not apriori known and the user is required to assign
					this. A view-cine along with its metadata i.e. the beginning and
					ending R-wave interval, beats per minute and LV orientation are
					required to start the fitting process.</p>
			</div>
			<!-- Accordion item -->
			<div data-dojo-type="dijit.TitlePane"
				title="Assigning LV orientation to view-cine" open="false">

				<p>The view-cine&#8217;s LV orientation can be assigned to a
					standard LV orientation by selecting the view in the &#8216;Views
					Organiser&#8217;, this will load the view-cine in the video widget
					and its metadata, and clicking the orientation icon in the fitting
					control.</p>
				<p>The view metadata can be modified before or after assigning
					the orientation. One or more view-cine&#8217;s may be assigned a LV
					orientation, however for a chamber model, only one of the
					cine-views would be used for a LV orientation and this will be the
					view-cine displayed on the fitting control.</p>
				<p>If you wish to assign a different view-cine to a standard LV
					orientation, clicking on the fitting control would flash an error
					that &#8216;A view has been assigned to the imaging plane. Remove
					the assigned view to continue&#8217;. The assigned view-cine can be
					removed by clicking on the red-cross on the currently assigned
					view-cine in that fitting control. Clicking again would assign the
					chosen view-cine to that LV orientation.</p>

				open="false">
				<p>Once the view-cine&#8217;s have been selected, click
					&#8216;Fit model&#8217; button. This will open the boundary
					specification window.</p>
				<h4>Endocardial boundary specification controls</h4>
				<p>
					<img width="602" height="380" src="./ABI/helpdocs/USW2.png" />
				</p>
				<p>1. Time slider for long axis views. Use this to selected end

				<p>4. Button to start speckle tracking based on chosen boundary
					information</p>
				<p>5. Button to start speckle tracking based on chosen boundary
					information, the speckle tracked motion is then used to fit a model
				</p>
				<p>6. Return back to the standard view with study data</p>
				<p>The wizard will present boundary selection controls for each
					of the views chosen. Therefore the wizard and controls will look
					different from the example screenshot shown above. The long axis
					boundary selection controls differ from the short axis ones.</p>

				<h4>Long axis boundary selection</h4>
				<p>
					<img width="602" height="498" src="./ABI/helpdocs/USW3.png" />
				</p>
				<p>The long axis boundary selection process involves selection
					of the LV base endpoints and apex. This is shown in the top-left
					figure. The widget, by default, shows the frame at the beginning of
					the R-wave. When these three landmarks are chosen, the widget
					provides an approximate endocardial boundary with additional
					control points to move the boundary to match the boundary on the
					image. Note that order in which the points are selected is
					immaterial, however, the first three points on the widget would
					correspond to these control points and using their coordinates a
					chamber boundary will be created. When placing points on the image,
					the widget ensures that they are not too close. For instance, if
					you have added a point and click close to it a new point will not
					be added, rather the point closest to the clicked position is moved
					to that point.</p>
				<p>If you are not happy with the boundary, the reset option, 1,
					allows you to reset all the landmarks in the widget and start it
					afresh. You could also return back to the view and start the wizard
					again. This will reset all landmark selections across all widgets!!
				</p>
				<p>At the beginging of the R-wave frame, the widget divides the
					chamber into the standard three long axis sections (white lines) of
					the 17 segment AHA strain analysis model. The user should aim to
					align these lines to match expectations.</p>
				<p>When there are two or more long axis views, the time sliders
					of the widget to the right is synched with the widget on its
					immediate left. Therefore, when the time slider is moved for the
					leftmost long axis widget the others will follow, this is aimed to
					help selecting the end systole frame consistently across the views
					and it also is an indicator of the beat mismatch between the
					view-cines.</p>
				<p>Following the selection of end diastole markers, the base
					plane at the end systole needs to be specified. To do this, move
					the time slider to the frame that best describes the LV geometry at
					end systole (indicated in the bottom left of the figure). Select
					the base-plane end points by clicking on the widget. The widget
					then displays a control, 2, which can be used to get to this frame
					when the slider is moved. The apex can be specified in this frame,
					but this is optional. When the apex is specified an approximate
					boundary of the LV chamber based on these points is plotted.</p>
				<p>Note that, three clicks correspond to the three landmarks. If
					you would like to alter the base control points, select the apex
					and then move the base points to the desired position.</p>
				<p>If you miss to specify both the end diastole and end systole
					landmarks, then that view will not be chosen for speckle tracking
					and model fitting. If none of the long axis views have this
					information an error message will be chosen to correct this,
					however, if at least one of the long axis views has this
					information, then no error will be shown.</p>
				<h4>Short axis boundary selection</h4>
				<p>
					<img width="602" height="204" src="./ABI/helpdocs/USW4.png" />
				</p>
				<p>For short axis views, the widget flips the image to enable
					easy boundary detection. Click on the image at the two furthest
					endocardial boundary locations. The widget will then create a
					circular boundary with additional control points to approximate the
					endocardial boundary. Move the boundary points to best fit the
					endocardial boundary in that frame.</p>
			</div>
			<!-- Accordion item -->
			<div data-dojo-type="dijit.TitlePane"
				title=" Verifying speckle tracking" open="false">

				<p>The boundary tracked via speckle motion can be verified prior
					to fitting a model to the boundary motion. This can be done by
					clicking on the &#8216;Track Motion&#8217; button. On clicking the
					button the selected views, metadata and landmark information is
					passed to the speckle tracking service and a progress bar
					indicating the progress of the tracking process is displayed. The
					speed of tracking depends on the number of views submitted and the
					server load. Once the tracking successfully completes, the
					verification wizard is displayed with the boundary motion and
					strain data.</p>
				<p>
					<img width="601" height="270" src="./ABI/helpdocs/USW5.png" />
				</p>
				<h4>Verification controls</h4>
				<p>1. For long axis views, the tracked speckle locations are
					displayed as circles. These circles can be moved to desired
					position. The strain graph, 4, is automatically updated to reflect
					to wall change. Note that the change in position is not propagated
					along time and space. The user will have check and change across
					each frame.</p>
				<p>2. If you would like to reset the changes made to the current
					frame. Click on &#8216;Rest to tracked results&#8217;</p>
				<p>3. For short axis views, the circular boundary can be moved
					to capture the endocardical boundary</p>
				<p>4. The 17 segment strain values based on the current tracking
					is displayed in the strain graph. Note that the number of strain
					values depends on the number of long axis views that have been
					submitted to speckle tracking</p>
				<p>5. The strains that have been selected to compute the average
					wall motion strain and the peak global longitudinal strain (PGLS)
					are listed. If a strain is included in the calculation the checkbox
					next to the strain number is checked. Unselecting an existing
					strain will remove the strain from the strain graph and the average
					strain and PGLS are recomputed.</p>
				<p>6. The PGLS value for the selected strains in control 5</p>
				<p>7. The views that have been tracked for motion. The user can
					select/deselect each available view to see the strains contributed
					by that view. Note that no short axis strains are plotted and their
					selection/deselection does not have an effect on controls 4 and 5.
					However, this control also serves the purpose of choosing which
					views and their wall motion should be used to fit the LV geometry
					model. Thus a number of models can be generated by combining the
					available view data. Each model would require a unique name and
					this can be specified using control 8.</p>
				<p>8. Name/identifier for the LV geometry model that would be
					fit using the selected views in control 7.</p>
				<p>9. The common play/pause and seek time slider for all the
					speckle tracking result views.</p>
				<p>To fit a model, click on &#8216;Fit to Tracking&#8217;, this
					will submit the fit request and display a progress bar to indicate
					the progress. Once a model is fit to the data, the model is added
					to the &#8216;Models&#8217; views and a dialog would notify this.
					You can return to this page by closing the dialog and existing
					tracking data is not lost and you may create models or modify the
					tracking output. You can also switch to the models tab and view the
					fitting results. The data in the verification pane for that study
					will not be lost.</p>
				<p>You can return to the study view, by clicking &#8216;Return
					to View&#8217; control. This will clear any speckle tracking
					results associated with the study.</p>
				<p>You can return to the tracking menu, where you choose the
					initial landmarks, by clicking &#8216;Return to Tracking&#8217;
					control. This will clear any speckle tracking results.</p>
