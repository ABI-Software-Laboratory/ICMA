This software is a part of ICMA 1.0, it is released under MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1

Requirements
============
ITK 4.2 or higher - (www.itk.org)
cmgui v2.9.0 - (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmiss/files/cmgui/cmgui-wx-2.9.0/)
Boost C++ libraries - (www.boost.org/)

Builds
======
ITK build
cmgui library build *without* itk - cmgui does not hide names and uses a older version of ITK, this causes name clashes if itk is included in the library

cmake
=====
The Cmgui_DIR can be set in the cmake file or using cmake-gui, ensure that you point to the cmake definitions of the cmgui library build without itk
 
Code organization
=================
The graphs folder provides some information on module interactions in the form of image and a dot files (viewed using Graphviz compatible viewers)
