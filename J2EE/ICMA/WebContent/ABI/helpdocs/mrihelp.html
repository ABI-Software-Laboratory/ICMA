				<h2>Patient MRI Dashboard</h2>
				<p>The MRI dashboard provides integrated access to the patient&#8217;s
					MRI studies. Each study is presented as a tab and consists of
					observations along one or more MRI view axis. Each view is
					associated with some metadata. By default the cine and metadata
					associated with the first view in the &#8216;Views&#8216; portal is loaded when
					a study tab is selected. The cine can be played or queried using
					the playable video widget at the centre of the dashboard.</p>

				<h2>Model fitting and strain analysis</h2>
				<p>Strain analysis requires a model to be fitted to the wall.
					The fitting process involves two stages</p>
				<p>1. Specify endocardial apex and base-plane at end diastole
					(ED) and end systole (ES) for at least one long axis view plane</p>
				<p>2. Specify the location of right ventricular inserts in at
					least one short axis view</p>
			</div>
			<div data-dojo-type="dijit.TitlePane"
				title="Specification of long axis control points" open="false">
				<h2>Specification of long axis control points</h2>
				<p>An MRI study may contain more than one long axis
					investigation. Select the one that passes through the middle of the
					left ventricular (LV) chamber. This view can be determined using
					the 3D rendering in the widget to the right.</p>
				<p>
					<img width="601" height="240"
						src="./ABI/helpdocs/MRI2.png" />
					Some MR recordings may cover more than one cardiac cycle. Select
					the cardiac cycle of interest using the time slider and control 7.
					To specify the end of cardiac cycle, move the time slider to the
					desired frame and click on control 7. The beginning of the cardiac
					cycle is determined by the end diastole frame.
				</p>
				<p>The end diastole frame is specified by the earliest time
					frame at which endocardial landmarks are specified. When the end
					diastole frame has been specified, the ED control, 5, is enabled.
					The user can return to this frame to verify/modify the landmarks by
					clicking on the control.</p>
				<p>The baseplane landmarks at end systole frame are required.
					The end systole frame occurs post the end diastole frame, using the
					time slider move to the end systole frame and specify the base
					plane land marks.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-dojo-type="dijit.TitlePane"
				title="Specification of Short axis RV Inserts" open="false">
				<h2>Specification of Short axis RV Inserts</h2>
				<p>Select a short axis imaging plane that passes close to the
					base of the LV chamber and allows you to clearly view the locations
					at which the right ventricular wall meets the LV chamber.</p>
				<p>
					<img width="263" height="309"
						src="./ABI/helpdocs/MRI3.png" />
				</p>
				<p>Select these two points by clicking on the widget. No other
					time specific information is required. Note that the video widget
					does not know if the cine that it is rendering is a short axis on
					or a long axis slice. Therefore, it provides the same controls for
					both cines. The user can easily identify the axis and therefore is
					expected to specify the control points appropriately. The fitting
					process uses this meta information (number of points) to determine
					which of the slices are along the short and long axis.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-dojo-type="dijit.TitlePane" title="Model fitting"
				open="false">
				<p>Model fitting</p>
				<p>To fit the model, specify the landmarks and provide a model
					name. Click on &#8216;Fit Model&#8217; to initiate the process. A progress bar
					is launched to indicate the fitting progress. Once a model is fit
					to the data, the model is added to the &#8216;Models&#8216; views and a dialog
					would notify this.</p>
