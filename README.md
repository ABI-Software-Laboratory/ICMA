Cardiac ultrasound and MRI image processing and analysis

Code for various modules of the ICMA project are available in the CPP and J2EE folders. As their names imply, CPP contains code written in C++, while the J2EE based code is available in the J2EE folder.

Each C++ module contains a test case in the src/Testing folder and the external software (and the type of build) required to build these modules are available in src/Release_Notes.txt. 

The J2EE/JBOSSInstallation folder provides the steps that need to be followed to install the J2EE components on a JBOSS AS 7.1.1 instance. It also has support files and sql scripts to create the database.


Best Wishes
