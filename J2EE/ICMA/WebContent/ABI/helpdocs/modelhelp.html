				<p>The Model dashboard provides integrated access to all the
					patient&#8217;s models. The model tabs are arranged in chronologically
					ascending order. Based on the source of the model i.e. ultrasound
					speckle tracking or MRI, the information presented in the model
					analysis perspective varies.</p>

					classify models with a center can be specified using the control S.
					The gravitational condition under which the study was performed can
					be specified using the control G.</p>
				<p>Whenever data is added or modified, the changes must be saved
